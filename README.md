# Chess WPF Application

## Background

I made a chess game for my A-Level Computer Science project. It was terrible.
It took upwards of 30 seconds to select a move at a reasonable difficulty. It
was also made using WinForms, and I had no clue what I was doing.

My aim is to remake and improve upon what I made then, and to *actually* understand
what I am doing this time.
